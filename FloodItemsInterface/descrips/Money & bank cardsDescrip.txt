Money may be needed for food, transport 
phone credit and other general needs.

When you are safe, the first phone call
should be to the insurance company to 
register a claim. 
When the claim goes live you can begin 
to pay for things.

It is important to get permission from 
the insurance company before paying for 
things.
This can usually be done by phone.
