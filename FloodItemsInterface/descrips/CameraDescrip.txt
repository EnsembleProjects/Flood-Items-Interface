Camera - think about this before a flood:
Remember to take pictures of all possessions before flooding 
Keep pictures (or memory stick with pictures) with insurance documents
Its easy to forget what you what you have lost in a flood 
so keeping photos can help when making an insurance claim.
Where safe, take photos of damage to property such as waterline.
