Before a flood take pictures of 
possessions.

Keep the pictures (or memory stick 
of pictures) with insurance documents.

Floods can be stressful and it's easy
to forget what you have lost in the 
flood, so keeping photos can help when 
making an insurance claim.

If it is safe, take photos of damage 
to property for example the flood 
waterline.
