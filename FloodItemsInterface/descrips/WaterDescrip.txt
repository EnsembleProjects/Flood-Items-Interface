In a flood, water sources may be 
contaminated or the supply could 
be cut off.

If this happens, there is no tap water 
for drinking, cooking & washing.

Keep bottled water stored, in case 
you can't use tap water.

Remember to check sell by dates and 
change water bottles before the 
sell by date expires.
