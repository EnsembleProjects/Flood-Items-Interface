Lots of people expect to try to 
use the Internet to get information 
during a flood. 
If the electricity supply fails 
routers may not work and Internet 
providers may be affected.

If the local radio station is not 
affected by flooding, it will be 
a place to find local information 
about what is happening and what to do.
