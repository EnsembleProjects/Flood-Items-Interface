Documents:
The insurance policy document is very important so keep it safe & dry.
Make a note or insurance incident line and policy number and keep in purse/wallet 
in case you have to leave without belongings. 
Alternatively take a photo of numbers and keep safe.
Remember things stored digitally may be inaccessible if the electricity or internet service is disrupted
or if electronic devices are destroyed by water.
Try to keep a back up.
